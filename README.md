# STAR WARS API APP
<br>

*In web development, it’s critical that you work with a REST API (Application Programming Interface) and understand what it is. In this application I introduced myself to work with API’s.Star-Wars-Api app pulls the data from a free API [swapi.co](https://swapi.co/) to pull in datathat holds information about Star Wars characters. This data is then displayed to users of the application in the Tabular format once the app loads.
This app is designed to get a taste of working with a RESTful API as well as to continue to go deeper into React*.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install latest version of Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) depending upon the platform that you will be running this app on. 
Any Editor of your choice. I used **Visual Studio Code** since it is easy to use and comes with bunch of plugins. You can download one if you wish by visiting [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/), again depending on the platform that you are using.
Download [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to run git commands.

## Getting Started
