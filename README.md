# STAR WARS API APP
<br>

*In web development, it’s critical that you work with a REST API (Application Programming Interface) and understand what it is. In this application I introduced myself to work with API’s.Star-Wars-Api app pulls the data from a free API [swapi.co](https://swapi.co/) to pull in datathat holds information about Star Wars characters. This data is then displayed to users of the application in the Tabular format once the app loads.
This app is designed to get a taste of working with a RESTful API as well as to continue to go deeper into React*.
